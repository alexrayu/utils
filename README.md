# utils

Various PHP utilities that I keep reusing.
This is mostly a source of packed snippets.

- *csvmerge.php* - Merge CSV files together by a given key, preserving headers.
- *csvgenid.php* - Generate unique ids for each row.
- *csvappend.php* - Append data with different base id into csv.
- *csvverifyfiles.php* - Verify if files listed in csv are present.
- *csvimages.php* - Dump images embedded in CSV as binary blobs.
